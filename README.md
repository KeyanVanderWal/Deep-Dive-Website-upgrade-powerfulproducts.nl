For this assignment I worked with three other students to improve and adapt the website "https://www.powerfulproducts.nl/".

We carried out this project during a Deep-Dive week. During such a week we work on assignments for real companies and adapt their website based on their wishes.

On the first day of a Deep-Dive week, various companies come by with their own websites. We choose one from these websites to get started with and adjust theire website to theire liking.

On friday we show them the final results and let them give theire rating.
